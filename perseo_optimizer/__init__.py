The overall vision of PerSeO is to help people optimize RF designs modeled in Ansys HFSS and get better performance before construction without requiring very advanced Python knowledge. It offers freedom over the tuning function, applies the PSO optimization algorithm for this purpose and generates logs about the executed optimizations and generated reports to be used at any time.

Modules:
    messages

    commands

    ansys_functions

    dataManagement

    graphicsManagement

    interface

    optimize
